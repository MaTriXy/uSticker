    <string name="help_text">uSticker lets you use images from your
        external storage as stickers in Gboard. Just copy your images to
        <u><b>/sdcard/Pictures/Stickers/</b></u>, then press the refresh
        button below and they will show up in the Gboard sticker list.\n

        \nHave too many stickers to scroll through? Create sub-folders
        inside the stickers folder, and we\'ll generate a new sticker tab
        for each in Gboard.\n
