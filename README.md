# uSticker

uSticker is a local-storage sticker provider for Gboard. Want to save all
your stickers locally, but don't want to search for them in your gallery?
uSticker lets you access them directly inside Gboard!

Note that this is strictly a personal project, and the feature set will be
determined by my own needs. I make this app public only in the hopes
that you share my use-case and find it useful; please do not submit
feature requests.

## Usage

1. Save stickers to your phone's storage
2. Run uSticker and press 'Refresh sticker index'
3. ???
4. Profit!

## FAQ

### Why does this even exist?

I'm a sticker addict, and I recently switched from WeChat to Signal. The
only thing I miss is the convenience of sending stickers, hence this app.

### What's the difference between this and other sticker packs?

uSticker lets you use your *own* stickers, not some pre-defined set
of images. Obviously, if you don't have any stickers, this app won't be very
useful.

### Will you add support for (insert app here)?

If it supports Gboard stickers, then it already works. Otherwise, no. I will
not go out of my way to support an app I do not use.

### How can I support this project?

By using it :-)
