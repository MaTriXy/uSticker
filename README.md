# uSticker

uSticker is a local-storage sticker provider for Gboard. Want to save all
your stickers locally, but don't want to search for them in your gallery?
uSticker lets you access them directly inside Gboard!

Note that this is strictly a personal project, and the feature set will be
determined by my own needs. I make this app public only in the hopes
that you share my use-case and find it useful; please do not submit
feature requests.

## Announcement

Shameless self promotion: Love using uSticker, but switched to an iPhone?
Try [Stickerboard](https://github.com/apsun/Stickerboard)! It's got the
same great feature set, for the same great price of $0.00!

uSticker will continue to be maintained for the foreseeable future, but
don't expect me to spend too much time investigating issues. If you submit
an issue, please search to see if it's one of the dozens of known Gboard
bugs first.

## Usage

1. Save stickers to your phone's storage
2. Run uSticker and press 'import stickers'
3. ???
4. Profit!

## Known issues

If you get the message "Something went wrong" when trying to send a sticker
in Gboard, try opening the uSticker app (you don't need to re-import, just
opening the app should be sufficient). I believe this has to do with
something about content providers and reboots. Android 11 has been a
complete dumpster fire.

If you get any other errors, please submit a bug report and attach a logcat
dump.

## FAQ

### Why does this even exist?

I'm a sticker addict, and I recently switched from WeChat to Signal. The
only thing I miss is the convenience of sending stickers, hence this app.

### What's the difference between this and other sticker packs?

uSticker lets you use your *own* stickers, not some pre-defined set
of images. Obviously, if you don't have any stickers, this app won't be very
useful.

### Will you add support for (insert app here)?

If it supports Gboard stickers, then it already works. Otherwise, no. I will
not go out of my way to support an app I do not use.

### How can I support this project?

By using it :-)
